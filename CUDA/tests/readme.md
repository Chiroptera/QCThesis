# Test 1
Benchmarking K_Means3 using the "index" reconstruction method.
Results for the "Python" labelling method are only in the log file
since it was taking one hour to cluster N=5e5, K=500, ITERS=3 for
each round.

The datasets were Gaussian mixtures, generated on the spot and not stored.

# test1v2
Same as test1 but results are saved in .csv. This format is human readable, more flexible to work with and Pandas reads it really fast.
