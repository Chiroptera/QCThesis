The programming model used for the GPU was CUDA, used through a Python library called Numba.
This library offers an interface to access most of CUDA's capabilities, but not all.
One of those capabilities is Dynamic Parallelism.
This offers the ability of having a host kernel call on other host kernel without intervention from the host.
This translates in the possibility of moving the control logic in the Bor≈Øvka variant (and also its the Connected Components Labeling variant) to the device, effectevely removing the memory transfer of values related with the control logic.

Adaptation of the present implementation to OpenCL. This brings major benefits in respect to portability since OpenCL supports most devices. Moreover, OpenCL's performance is catching in on that of CUDA's and since it's programming model was based on CUDA, it should be straightforward for developers to make the switch.

Application of EAC to the MapReduce framework will further expand the possibilities of application of EAC.

Study the integration of other clustering algorithms within the the EAC toolchain.

A good follow-up of the present work is to study the relationship between several metrics (e.g. sparsity, accuracy, maximum number of co-associations) and the complexity of the dataset. Some metrics for describing the complexity of the dataset exist (Tin Kam Ho) and it would be interesting to profile several datasets of different complexities and structures and search for the former relationship.
On a performance perspective it could prove useful to deduce better rules to set the maximum number of associations in the sparse matrix.
On a accuracy perspective it would be interesting to see if there are types of datasets that simply are not a good fit for EAC while other are. It would also be interesting to relate complexity with the threshold cut-off.
