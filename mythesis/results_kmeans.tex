\section{Parallel K-Means}
\label{sec:parallel kmeans}

This section will present results relevant to the GPU parallel K-Means.
Its purpose is to understand how data set complexity (cardinality, dimensionality and number of clusters) affects the speed-up of the GPU version over the CPU.
All tests were executed on machine Charlie.

\subsection{Maximum potential speed-up}

Previously, it was mentioned that the methodology followed for speeding up an application was to first profile the code and identify the portions of code that can be optimized and what fraction of the total computational time they take.
Table \ref{tab:kmeans max speedup} presents statistical results on the theoretical maximum speed-up for the two K-Means phases.
The sequential version of K-Means was executed over a wide spectrum of data sets varying cardinality, dimensionality and number of clusters.
The theoretical maximum speed-up is considered to be the overall speed-up of the algorithm if one of its phases had infinite speed-up, i.e. when its time is negligible relative to the other phases.
Analyzing these results it is clear that the labeling phase holds the most potential for optimizations.
Furthermore, the theoretical speed-up also increases with the problem complexity (number of patterns, dimensions and centroids).
The theoretical speed-up of the update phase is almost negligible when compared to the labeling phase.
This illustrates the importance of profiling the code before proceeding with optimizations, since effort invested in the update phase would yield little effect.

\subsection{Analysis of speed-up}

Observing Figures \ref{fig:kmeans dim 2} and \ref{fig:kmeans dim 200}, it is clear that cardinality, dimensionality and number of clusters influence the speed-up.
It should be noted that whenever the number of clusters was superior to $70\%$ of the number of patterns, that particular test case was not executed.
For the simple case of 2 dimensions (Fig \ref{fig:kmeans dim 2}, the speed-up increases with the number of patterns.
However, there is no speed-up when the overall complexity of the data sets is low.
For 2 clusters, there is no speed-up before a cardinality of $100 \: 000$.
And even after that mark, the speed-up is not significant.
On the other hand, for a large number of clusters, there is speed-up for any cardinality executed.
Not only that, that speed-up is highest of any other case with inferior number of number of clusters.
The reason for this is that the total amount of work increases linearly with the number of clusters but is diluted by the number of threads that can execute simultaneously.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{{results/kmeans/fixed_dimensions/2.0}}}
    \caption{Speed-up of the labeling phase for data sets of 2 dimensions and varying cardinality and number of clusters. The dotted black line represents a speed-up of one.}
    \label{fig:kmeans dim 2}
\end{figure}

However, as the dimensionality increases (observe Fig. \ref{fig:kmeans dim 200}), the speed-up increases until a certain cardinality and then decreases.
Here, the initial cardinality for which there is a speed-up is lower than in the low dimensionality case and the number of clusters plays less an influence on the speed-up.
It is believed that the reason for this is related to the implementation itself.
The current parallel implementation does not use shared memory, which is fast.
As such, for every computation, each thread fetches the relevant data from global memory which is significantly slower.
As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data that each thread must fetch also increases.
Furthermore, since the number of dimensions affects both data points and centroids, if the number of dimensions increases by 2 the number of fetches to memory increases by 4.
So, the speed-up increases with the data set complexity until a point where the number of fetches to memory starts having a very significant effect on the execution time and it decreases close to $50\%$.

As it stands, this implementation of K-Means excels in low-dimensional data sets with a high number of centroids.
Good performance on a high number of centroids is a desireble thing given the overall context

\subsection{Effective bandwidth and computational throughput}

Effective bandwidth and throughput are two useful metrics to measure the efficiency of CUDA programs.
The effective bandwidth was computed by summing the times of transferring data to and fro the device divided by the total amount of data transfered and is usually represented in GBytes/s.
The computational throughput is usually represented in GFLOP/s (“Giga-FLoating-point OPerations per second”).
These metrics were computed from the results and a statistical overview is presented in Table \ref{tab:kmeans performance metrics}.
The results refer only to the labeling phase to make a fair comparison between CPU and GPU.
The computational throughput of the GPU is more than 3 times higher than that of the CPU, on average.
However, it is interesting to note that the minimum GPU throughput is significantly lower than the CPU.
This is because of what was seen in previous sections, where the data set complexity is too low for the overhead associated with using the GPU does not yet outweigh the benefit of the parallel computation.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the effective metrics of the GPU are well below the maximum theoretical presented in the device specifications, which are a bandwidth of 288 GB/s and a throughput of 4.29 TFLOP/s.
This suggests that the GPU usage on the presented test cases is still underused.
