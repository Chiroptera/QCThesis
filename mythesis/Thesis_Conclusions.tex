Adaptation of the present implementation to OpenCL. This brings major benefits in respect to portability since OpenCL supports most devices. Moreover, OpenCL's performance is catching in on that of CUDA's and since it's programming model was based on CUDA, it should be straightforward for developers to make the switch.

Application of EAC to the MapReduce framework will further expand the possibilities of application of EAC.

Study the integration of other clustering algorithms within the the EAC toolchain.
