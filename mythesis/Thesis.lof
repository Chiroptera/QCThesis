Fig. \ref {fig:intro natural} shows the desired labels for each point, where each color is coded to a class.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces The output labels of the K-Means algorithm with the number of clusters (input parameter) set to 3. The different plots show the centroids (squares) evolution on each iteration. Between iteration 3 and the converged state 2 more iterations were executed.\relax }}{9}{figure.caption.9}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces The above figures show an example of a graph (left) and its corresponding Minimum Spanning Tree (right). The circles are vertices and the edges are the lines linking the vertices.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces The above plots show the dendrogram and a possible clustering taken from a Single-Link run over the Iris data set. Fig. \ref {fig:sl clustering} was obtained by performing a cut on a level that would yield a partition of 3 clusters.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.11}
