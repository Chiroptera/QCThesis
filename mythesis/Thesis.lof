\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.4}{\ignorespaces The above plots show the dendrogram and a possible clustering taken from a Single-Link run over the Iris data set. Fig. \ref {fig:sl clustering} was obtained by performing a cut on a level that would yield a partition of 3 clusters.\relax }}{8}{figure.caption.11}
