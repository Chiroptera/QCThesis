abstract = {By reviewing the original INIQGA algorithm, an improved algorithm (IINIQGA) is put forward by revising the lookup table. In addition, By introducing the variable angle-distance rotation method into the update Q(t) procedure, a novel quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, QEA-VAR, was proposed. Compared with previous algorithms, our update Q(t) procedure is more simple and feasible. Finally, the corresponding experiments on the 0-1 knapsack problem were carried out, and the results show that our improvement is efficient, and comparing with IINIQGA, QEA, and CGA, QEA-VAR has a faster convergence and better profits than other algorithms.},

abstract = {The ability to cluster data accurately is essential to applications such as image segmentation. Therefore, techniques that enhance accuracy are of keen interest. One such technique involves applying a quantum mechanical system model, such as that of the quantum bit, to generate probabilistic numerical output to be used as variable input for clustering algorithms. This work demonstrates that applying a quantum bit model to data clustering algorithms can increase clustering accuracy, as a result of simulating superposition as well as possessing both guaranteed and controllable convergence properties. For accuracy assessment purposes, four quantum-modeled clustering algorithms for multi-band image segmentation are explored and evaluated. The clustering algorithms of choice consist of quantum variants of K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, New Weighted Fuzzy C- Means, and the Artificial Bee Colony. Data sets of interest include multi-band imagery, which subsequent to classification are analyzed and assessed for accuracy. Results demonstrate that these algorithms exhibit improved accuracy, when compared to classical counterparts. Moreover, solutions are enhanced via introduction of the quantum state machine, which provides random initial centroid and variable input values to the various clustering algorithms, and quantum operators, which bring about convergence and maximize local search space exploration. Typically, the algorithms have shown to produce better solutions. Keywords:},

@article{Xiao2010,
abstract = {The number of clusters has to be known in advance for the conventional k-means clustering algorithm and moreover the clustering result is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centroids. This sensitivity may make the algorithm converge to the local optima. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm for k-means clustering (KMQGA). In KMQGA, a Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as the typical genetic algorithm operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bits. Different from the typical quantum-inspired genetic algorithms (QGA), the length of a Q-bit in KMQGA is variable during evolution. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, KMQGA can obtain the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids. Both the simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA, respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and effective. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
