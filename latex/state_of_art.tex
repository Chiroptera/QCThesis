\subsection{Quantum clustering}
The field of quantum computing has shown promising results regarding potential speedups in several tasks over their classical counterparts. 
There are two major paths for the problem of quantum clustering. The first is the quantization of clustering methods to work in quantum computers. This translates in converting algorithms to work partially or totally on a different computing paradigm, with support of quantum circuits or quantum computers. Literature suggests that quadratic (and even exponential in some cases) speedup may be achieved. Most of the approaches for such conversions make use of Groover's search algorithm, or a variant of it, e.g. ~\cite{Wiebe2014}. Most literature on this path is also mostly theoretical since quantum circuits are not easily available and a working feasible quantum computer has yet to be invented. This path can be seen as part of the bigger problem of quantum computing and quantum information processing.

% #TODO get refs for simulation of quantum systems not being feasable; Feynmann; I think washington course had something -->

An alternative to using real quantum systems would be to simulate them. However, simulating quantum systems is a very hard task by itself and literature suggest is not feasible. Given that the scope of the thesis is to accelerate clustering, having the extra overhead of simulating the systems would allow speedups.

The second path is the computational intelligence approach, i.e.  to use quantum inspired algorithms that muster inspiration from quantum analogies. A study of the literature will reveal that this path typically further divides itself into two other branches. One comprehends the algorithms based on the concept of the quantum bit, the quantum analogue of a classical bit with interesting properties found in quantum objects. The other branch models data as a quantum system and uses the Schrödinger equation to evolve it.

In the following two sections these approaches for quantum inspired computational intelligence are explored.

\subsubsection{Quantum bit}

The quantum bit is a quantum object that has the properties of quantum superposition, entanglement and ...

% taken from notebook -->

A qubit can have any value between 0 and 1 (superposition property) until it is observed, which is when the system collapses to either state. However, the probability with which the system collapses to either state  may be different. The superposition property or linear combination of states can be expressed as

$$
[\psi] = \alpha[0] + \beta[1]
$$

where $\psi$ is an arbitrary state vector and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the the probability amplitude coefficients of basis states $[0]$ and $[1]$, respectevely. The basis states correspond to the spin of the modeled particle (in this case, a ferminion, e.g. electron). The coefficients are subjected to the following normalization:

$$|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

where $|\alpha|^2$, $|\beta|^2$ are the probabilities of observing states $[0]$ and $[1]$, respectevely. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex quantities and represent a qubit:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta
\end{bmatrix}$$

Moreover, a qubit string may be represented by:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\left.\begin{matrix}
\alpha_1\\ 
\beta_1
\end{matrix}\right| & \left.\begin{matrix}
\alpha_2\\ 
\beta_2
\end{matrix}\right| & \begin{matrix}
\alpha_3\\ 
\beta_3
\end{matrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The probability of observing the state $[000]$ will be $|\alpha_1|^2 \times |\alpha_2|^2 \times |\alpha_3|^2$

To use this model for computing purposes, black-box objects called *oracles* are used.

% end of notebook -->

% #TODO get ref -->
Def from wiki: In complexity theory and computability theory, an oracle machine is an abstract machine used to study decision problems. It can be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to decide certain decision problems in a single operation. The problem can be of any complexity class. Even undecidable problems, like the halting problem, can be used. %from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine

In this context, oracles contain strings of qubits and generate their own input by observing the state of the qubits. After collapsing, the qubit value becomes analogue to a classical bit.

%#TODO get ref : see washington quantum computing classes -->


As it stands, oracles aren't quantum systems or even simulate them. The most appropriate description would be a probabilistic Turing machine.

Each string of qubits represents a number, so the number of qubits in each string will define its precision. The number of strings chosen for the oracles depends on the number of clusters and dimensionality of the problem (e.g. for 3 clusters of 2 dimensions, 6 strings will be used since 6 numbers are required). Each oracle will represent a possible solution.


\subsubsection{Quantum K-Means}

Several clustering algorithms ~\cite{Casper2013,Casper,Xiao2010}, as well as optimization problems ~\cite{Wang2013}, are modelled after this concept. To test the potential of the algorithms under this paradigm, a quantum variant of the K-Means algorithm based on~\cite{Casper} was chosen as a case study.

\subsubsection{Description of the algorithm}

The Quantum K-Means (QK-Means) algorithm, as is described in ~\cite{Casper}, is based on the classical K-Means algorithm. It extends the basic K-Means with concepts from quantum mechanics (the qubit) and genetic algorithms.

% (describe algorithm... - from notebook) -->
The algorithm has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize population of oracles
\item Collapse oracles
\item K-Means
\item Compute cluster fitness
\item Store
\item Quantum Rotation Gate
\item Collapse oracles
\item Quantum cross-over and mutation
\item Repeat 3-7 until generation (iteration) limit is reached
\end{enumerate}



The algorithm implemented and tested is a variant of the one described in ~\cite{Casper}. The genetic operations of cross-over and mutation are both part of the genetic algorithms toolbox, but were not implemented due to the suggestion from ~\cite{Wiebe2014}. This decision was based on the findings of ~\cite{Liu2010}, stating that the use of the angle-distance rotation method in the quantum rotation operation produces enough variability, with a careful choice of the rotation angle.

\paragraph{Initialize population of oracles}

The oracles are created in this step and all qubit coefficients are initialized with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, so that the system will observe either state with equal probability. This value is chosen taken into account the necessary normalization of the coefficients.

\paragraph{Collapse oracles}

Collapsing the oracles implies making an observation of each qubit of each qubit string in each oracle. This is done by first choosing a coefficient to use (either can be used), e.g. $\alpha$. Then, a random value $r$ between 0 and 1 is generated. If $\alpha \ge r$ then the system collapses to $[0]$, otherwise to $[1]$.

\paragraph{K-Means}
In this step we convert the binary representation of the qubit strings to base 10 and use them those values as initial centroids for K-Means. For each oracle, classical K-Means is then executed until it stabilizes or reaches the iteration limit. The solution centroids are returned to the oracles in binary representation.

\paragraph{Compute cluster fitness}
Cluster fitness is computed using the Davies-Bouldin index for each oracle. The score of each oracle is stored in the oracle itself.

\paragraph{Store}
The best scoring oracle is stored.

\paragraph{Quantum Rotation Gate}
So far, we've had classical K-Means with a complex random number generation for the centroids and complicated data structures. This is the step that fundamentally differs from the classical version. In this step a quantum gate (in this case a rotation gate) is applied to all oracles except the best one. The basic idea is to shift the qubit coefficients of the least scoring oracles so they'll have a higher probability of collapsing into initial centroid values closer to the best solution so far. This way, in future generations, we'll not initiate with the best centroids so far (which will not converge further into a better solution) but we'll be closer while still ensuring diversity (which is also a desired property of the genetic computing paradigm). In conclusion, we want to look for better solutions than the one we got before in each oracle while moving in the direction of the best we found so far.

The other approach to clustering that gathers inspiration from quantum mechanical concepts is to use the Schrödinger equation. The algorithm under study was created by Horn and Gottlieb and was later extended by Weisenberg? and Horn.

%TODO
% add ref

\subsubsection{Horn and Gottlieb's algorithm}

The first step in this methodology is to compute a probability density function of the input data. This is done with a Parzen-window estimator in ~\cite{Horn2001a,Weinstein2009}. This function will be the wave function in the Schrödinger equation. Having this information we'll compute the potential function that corresponds to the state of minimum energy (ground state = eigenstate with minimum eigenvalue) ~\cite{Horn2001a}.

This potential function is akin to the inverse of a probability density function. Minima of the potential correspond to intervals in space where points are together. So minima will naturally correspond to cluster centres ~\cite{Horn2001a}. The potential of every point in space is a costly computation. One method to address this problem is to compute the potential on the input data and converge this points toward some minima of the potential function. This is done with the gradient descent method in ~\cite{Horn2001a}. Another method ~\cite{Weinstein2009} is to think of the input data as particles and use the Hamiltonian operator to evolve the quantum system in the time-dependant Schrödinger equation. Given enough time steps, the particles will converge to and oscillate around potential minima.

Both methods take as input parameter the variance $\sigma$ of the parzen-window estimator.

% (from notebook Horn accuracy) -->
This method starts off by creating a Parzen-window density estimation of the input data by associating a Gaussian with each point, such that

$$ \psi (\mathbf{x}) = \sum ^N _{i=1} e^{- \frac{\left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2}{2 \sigma ^2}} $$

where $N$ is the total number of points in the dataset, $\sigma$ is the variance and $\psi$ is the probability density estimation. $\psi$ is chosen to be the wave function in Schrödinger's equation. The details of why this is are better described in ~\cite{Weinstein2009,Horn2001a,Horn2001b}. Schrödinger's equation is solved in order of the potential function $V(x)$, whose minima will be the centres of the clusters of our data:      

$$
V(\mathbf{x}) = E + \frac {\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\nabla^2 \psi }{\psi} 
= E - \frac{d}{2} + \frac {1}{2 \sigma^2 \psi} \sum ^N _{i=1} \left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2 e^{- \frac{\left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
$$

And since the energy should be chosen such that $\psi$ is the groundstate (i.e. eigenstate corresponding to minimum eigenvalue) of the Hamiltonian operator associated with Schrödinger's equation (not represented above), the following is true

$$
E = - min \frac {\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\nabla^2 \psi }{\psi}
$$

With all of this, $V(x)$ can be computed. However, it's very computationally intensive to compute V(x) to the whole space, so we only compute the value of this function close to the data points. This should not be problematic since clusters' centres are generally close to the data points themselves. Even so, the minima may not lie on the data points themselves, so what we do is compute the potential at all data points and then apply the gradient descent method to move them to regions in space with lower potential.

There is another method to evolve the system other then by gradient descent which is explained in ~\cite{Weinstein2009}. Together, this methods make the Dynamic Quantum Clustering algorithm % #TODO add ref -->.

\subsection{Big data clustering}
%this was taken from the Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications 
When big data is in discussion, two perspectives should be taken into account. The first deals with the applications where data is too large to be stored efficiently. This is the problem that streaming algorithms such as X,Y try to solve by analysing data as it is produced, close to real-time processing. %TODO give examples of streaming algorithms
The other perspective (the more common) is big data that is actually stored and processed. The latter is the perspective the present work deals with.

Scalability of EAC within the big data paradigm is the concern of this work. Although this line of research hasn't been pursued before, cluster analysis of big data has.%TODO confirm this
Since EAC uses traditional clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means, Single-Link) in its approach, it is useful to understand how scalable this components are. Furthermore, valuable insights may be taken from the techniques used in the scalability of other algorithms.

Several techniques should be mentioned: parallelization can be attained by adapting programs to multi core CPU, GPU, distributed over several machines or a combination of the former, e.g. parallel processing using GPU in a network of workstations.


\subsection{General Purporse computing on Graphical Processing Units}
%TODO add refs everywhere
Using Graphic Processing Units (GPU) for other applications other than graphic processing, commonly known as General Purpose computation in GPU (GPGPU), has become a trend in recent years.
Current GPUs pack hundreds of cores and have a better energy/area ratio than traditional setups.
GPUs work under the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) framework, i.e. all the cores in the device execute the same code at the same time and only the data changes over time.
At the time of writing, the major programming models used for computation in GPU are OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). While the first is widely available in most devices the later is only available for NVIDIA devices. 

\subsubsection{The choice between models: OpenCL or CUDA}
It basically boils down to OpenCL vs CUDA. OpenCL has the advantage of portability with the issues of performance portability and har d to program. Programming under CUDA , performs well since it was designed alongside with the hardware itself but only works on NVIDIA devices.

\subsubsection{MapReduce on GPU}
As Google's MapReduce computing model has increasingly become a standard for scalable and distributed computing over big data, attempts have been made to port the model to the GPU. This translates in using the same programming model over a wide array of computing platforms.



\subsection{Parallel computing}
The second direction of the work was given to parallel computing, more spefically to General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU).
