# Structured

The scope of the thesis is Big Data and Cluster Ensembles. To both, a main requirement is to have fast clustering techniques. This may be accomplished in two ways: algorithmically or with parallelization techniques. The former deals with finding faster solutions while the later takes existing solutions and optimizes them having execution speed in mind.

The initial research was under the algorithmic path. More specifically, exploring quantum clustering algorithms. The findings of this exploration were unproductive and turned the focus of the research to parallelization techniques. Two main paradigms of parallelization were found: GPU and distributed (among several machines).

# Quantum Clustering

There are two major paths for the problem of quantum clustering. The first is the quantization of clustering methods to work in quantum computers. This is basically converting algorithms to work partially or totally on a different computing paradigm, with support of quantum circuits or computers. Literature suggests that quadratic (and even exponential in some cases) speedup may be achieved. Most of the approaches for such conversions make use of Groover's search algorithm, or a variant of it, e.g. [1]. Most literature on this path is also quite theoretical since quantum computers or quantum circuits are not easily available. This path can be seen as part of the bigger problem of quantum computing and quantum information processing. 

The second path is the computational intelligence approach, i.e.  to use quantum inspired algorithms that muster inspiration from quantum analogies. A study of the literature will reveal that this path typically further divides itself into two other branches. One comprehends the algorithms based on the concept of the quantum bit, the quantum analogue of a classical bit with interesting properties found in quantum objects. The other branch models data as a quantum system and uses the Schr√∂dinger equation to evolve it.

## Quantum bit

The quantum bit is a quantum object that has the properties of quantum superposition, entanglement and ...

### (Introduce the concept further)

The implemented algorithm is described in more detail in [1,3].

This algorithm is based on the quantum bit (qubit) model. A qubit can have any value between 0 and 1 (superposition property) until it is observed, which is when the system collapses to either state. However, the probability with which the system collapses to either state  may be different. The superposition property or linear combination of states can be expressed as

$$
[\psi] = \alpha[0] + \beta[1]
$$

where $\psi$ is an arbitrary state vector and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the the probability amplitude coefficients of basis states $[0]$ and $[1]$, respectevely. The basis states correspond to the spin of the modeled particle (in this case, a ferminion, e.g. electron). The coefficients are subjected to the following normalization:

$$|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

where $|\alpha|^2$, $|\beta|^2$ are the probabilities of observing states $[0]$ and $[1]$, respectevely. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex quantities and represent a qubit:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta
\end{bmatrix}$$

Moreover, a qubit string may be represented by:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\left.\begin{matrix}
\alpha_1\\ 
\beta_1
\end{matrix}\right| & \left.\begin{matrix}
\alpha_2\\ 
\beta_2
\end{matrix}\right| & \begin{matrix}
\alpha_3\\ 
\beta_3
\end{matrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The probability of observing the state $[000]$ will be $|\alpha_1|^2 \times |\alpha_2|^2 \times |\alpha_3|^2$

To use this model for computing purposes, black-box objects called *oracles* are used. Oracles contain strings of qubits and generate their own input by observing the state of the qubits. After collapsing, the qubit value becomes analog to a classical bit. Each string of qubits represents a number, so the number of qubits in each string will define its precision. The number of strings chosen for the oracles depends on the number of clusters and dimensionality of the problem (e.g. for 3 clusters of 2 dimensions, 6 strings will be used since 6 numbers are required). Each oracle will represent a possible solution.

### (continued)

Several clustering algorithms [4-6], as well as optimization problems [7], are modelled after this concept. To test the potential of the algorithms under this paradigm, a quantum variant of the K-Means algorithm [5] was chosen as a case study.

## Quantum K-Means
### Description of the algorithm

The Quantum K-Means algorithm, as is described in [5], is based on the classical K-Means algorithm. It extends the basic K-Means with concepts from quantum mechanics (the qubit) and genetic algorithms.

#### (describe algorithm... - from notebook)

The algorithm has the following steps:
1. initialize population of oracles
2. Collapse oracles
3. K-Means
4. Compute cluster fitness
5. Store
6. Quantum Rotation Gate
7. Collapse oracles
8. Repeat 3-7 until generation (iteration) limit is reached

####  Initialize population of oracles
The oracles are created in this step and all qubit coefficients are initialized with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, so that the system will observe either state with equal probability.

#### Collapse oracles
Collapsing the oracles implies making an observation of each qubit of each qubit string in each oracle. This is done by first choosing a coefficient to use (which is irrelevant), e.g. $\alpha$. Then, we generate a random value $r$ between 0 and 1. If $\alpha \ge r$ then the system collapses to $[0]$, otherwise to $[1]$.

#### K-Means
In this step we convert the binary representation of the qubit strings to base 10 and use them those values as initial centroids for K-Means. For each oracle, classical K-Means is then executed until it stabilizes or reaches the iteration limit. The solution centroids are returned to the oracles in binary representation.

#### Compute cluster fitness
Cluster fitness is computed using the Davies-Bouldin index for each oracle. The score of each oracle is stored in the oracle itself.

#### Store
The best scoring oracle is stored.

#### Quantum Rotation Gate
So far, we've had classical K-Means with a complex random number generation for the centroids and complicated datastructures. This is the step that fundamentally differs from the classical version. In this step a quantum gate (in this case a rotation gate) is applied to all oracles except the best one. The basic idea is to shift the qubit coefficients of the least scoring oracles so they'll have a higher probability of collapsing into initial centroid values closer to the best solution so far. This way, in future generations, we'll not initiate with the best centroids so far (which will not converge further into a better solution) but we'll be closer while still ensuring diversity (which is also a desired property of the genetic computing paradigm). In conclusion, we want to look for better solutions than the one we got before in each oracle while moving in the direction of the best we found so far.

In the original formulation of this algorithm two extra step existed to further increase diversity: quantum crossover and quantum mutation inversion. Both are part of the genetic algorithms toolbox, but were not implemented due to the suggestion from [1] that they are unnecessary steps with the careful choice of the rotatin angle.

#### (continue)


The algorithm implemented and tested is a variant of the one described in [5]. The genetic operations of cross-over and mutation are taken away. This decision was based on the findings of [8], stating that the use of the angle-distance rotation method in the quantum rotation operation produces enough variability.

### Testing 
The testing was aimed at benchmarking both accuracy and speed. The input used was synthetic data, namely, Gaussian mixtures with variable cardinality and dimensionality. The results

(copy of report)

Regarding the Quantum K-Means (QK-Means), the tests were performed using 10 oracles, a qubit string length of 8 and 100 generations per round. The \textit{classical} K-Means was executed using the \textit{k-means++} centroid initialization method. Since QK-Means executes a classical K-Means for each oracle each generation, the number of initializations for K-Means was $\#oracles \times \#generations \times factor$, where $factor$ is a adjustable multiplier. Each test had 20 rounds.

All tests were done with 6 clusters (natural number of clusters). Two tests were done with the two dimensional dataset: one with a $factor=1.10$ (increase initializations by 10\%) and another with $factor=1$. I'll call these tests T1 and T2. The test done with the six dimensional dataset (T3) used $factor=1.10$.

The mean computation time of classical K-Means is an order of magnitude lower than that of QK-Means. However, in classical K-Means the solution typically chosen is the one with lowest sum of squared euclidean distances of points to their attributed centroid. To make a fair comparisson between the two algorithms, the Davies-Bouldin index of all classical K-Means solutions was computed and used as the criterea to choose the best solution. When this is done, we can see that the total time of classical K-Means is actually higher that that of QK-Means in T1 and T3, but this is only due to the 1.10 multiplier on the number of initializations. In T2, possibly the fairest comparisson, the computation times become very similar with only a 2\% difference between the two algorithms.

#### Accuracy
##### Comparing K-Means and QK-Means

which shows the best result in any round. The values represent the Davies-Bouldin
fitness index (low is better).

The most relevant result in the table above is the mean of the best index. The value is the average over all rounds of the best solution in each round and it provides insight on the average performance of the algorithm. The results suggest that both algorithms perform equally well. The best overall result of each algorithm in all rounds is exactly the same. In T3, the mean performance of classical K-Means is marginally better.

I speculate that if classical K-Means was using only the sum of euclidean distances and not the DB index, the average performance would be worse. As it stands, choosing to use DB index with classical K-Means possibly represents a tradeoff between speed and accuracy.

##### QK-Means details

Here we‚Äôll analyse a bit what‚Äôs happening within each QK-Means execution. One
would expect for the population‚Äôs fitness variance to decrease over the generations, as the probabilities for previous known solutions increase. The convergence of the population mean would also be expected to decrease for the same reason. However, experimental (Fig. 2 and 3) results don‚Äôt suggest any of these expectations (the results of T1 and T3 suggest the same). This may be due to low number of generations or simply because the random generation of initial centroids isn‚Äôt influenced enough by the qubit probabilities.



Analyzing the evolution of the DB index of the best solution over the generations (Fig. 4 and 5) gives some insight on the rate of convergence. In both tests it‚Äôs clear that the best solution is often reached in a quarter of the total generations. More detail can be seen in the following table.


Table 3: The values represent generations.

| T1   | 17.25 | 70.2875  | 3    | 33    |

## Schr√∂dinger equation
The first step in this methodology is to compute a probability density function of the input data. This is done with a Parzen-window estimator in [2,3] This function will be the wave function in the Schrodinger equation. Having this information we'll compute the potential function that corresponds to the state of minimum energy (ground state = eigenstate with minimum eigenvalue) [2].

This potential function is almost like the inverse of a probability density function. Minima of the potential correspond to intervals in space where points are together. So minima will naturally correspond to cluster centers [2]. The computation of the potential function on every point in space is a costly computation effort though, so what is done in one method is to compute the potential on the input data and converge this points toward the minima in the potential function. This is done with the gradient descent method in [2]. Another method [3] is to think of the input data as particles and use Hamiltonian operator to evolve the quantum system in the time-dependant Schrodinger equation. Given enough time steps, the particles will oscilate around potential minima.

Both methods take as input parameter the variance of the parzen-window estimator $sigma$.

### (from notebook Horn accuracy)
This method starts off by creating a Parzen-window density estimation of the input data by associating a Gaussian with each point, such that

$$ \psi (\mathbf{x}) = \sum ^N _{i=1} e^{- \frac{\left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2}{2 \sigma ^2}} $$

where $N$ is the total number of points in the dataset, $\sigma$ is the variance and $\psi$ is the probability density estimation. $\psi$ is chosen to be the wave function in Schr√∂dinger's equation. The details of why this is are better described in [1-4]. Schr√∂dinger's equation is solved in order of the potential function $V(x)$, whose minima will be the centers of the clusters of our data:

$$
V(\mathbf{x}) = E + \frac {\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\nabla^2 \psi }{\psi}
= E - \frac{d}{2} + \frac {1}{2 \sigma^2 \psi} \sum ^N _{i=1} \left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2 e^{- \frac{\left \| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i \right \| ^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
$$

And since the energy should be chosen such that $\psi$ is the groundstate (i.e. eigenstate corresponding to minimum eigenvalue) of the Hamiltonian operator associated with Schr√∂dinger's equation (not represented above), the following is true

$$
E = - min \frac {\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\nabla^2 \psi }{\psi}
$$

With all of this, $V(x)$ can be computed. However, it's very computationally intensive to compute V(x) to the whole space, so we only compute the value of this function close to the datapoints. This should not be problematic since clusters' centers are generally close to the datapoints themselves. Even so, the minima may not lie on the datapoints themselves, so what we do is compute the potential at all datapoints and then apply the gradient descent method to move them to regions in space with lower potential.

There is another method to evolve the system other then by gradient descent which is explained in [4] and complements this on the Dynamic Quantum Clustering algorithm.
